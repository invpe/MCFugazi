This plugin enables or disables PVP between players on demand.
Only enabled players can PVP without slaying the ones who are not interested.
Simply enable with: `/pvp` command or disable with `/pvp` command for yourself.

- Only players with `/pvp` enabled can fight each other
- The winner of the fight takes one heart from the looser
- There is a scoreboard where rank = `frags - deaths`
- Works with paper minecraft
